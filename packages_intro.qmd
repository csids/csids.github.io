```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("packages/hex_dependencies.png")
```

## Installation and Use

```{r}
#| column: margin
knitr::include_graphics("packages/csverse.png")
```

If you want to install the dev versions (or access packages that haven't been released on CRAN), run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to edit your `.Rprofile`. 

Then write in:

```
options(
  repos = structure(c(
    csverse = "https://www.csids.no/drat/",
    CRAN    = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
  ))
)
```

Save the file and restart R.

You can now install [csverse](https://www.csids.no/packages) packages from our [drat repository](https://www.csids.no.no/drat).
