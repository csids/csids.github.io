title: "Packages / csverse"
description: |
  A set of R packages developed to help solve problems that frequently occur when performing infectious disease surveillance.
  The csverse has been created by the Sykdomspulsen team (specialized in infectious disease surveillance), who use it every 
  day to streamline and improve their pipelines and deliverables. The csverse has been used and improved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, forming the basis of all of Sykdomspulsen's products. To put it more succinctly: "All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience."

## Installation and Use

```{r}
#| column: margin
knitr::include_graphics("packages/csverse.png")
```

If you want to install the dev versions (or access packages that haven't been released on CRAN), run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to edit your `.Rprofile`. 

Then write in:

```
options(
  repos = structure(c(
    csverse  = "https://www.csids.no/drat/",
    CRAN      = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
  ))
)
```

Save the file and restart R.

You can now install [csverse](https://www.csids.no/packages) packages from our [drat repository](https://www.csids.no.no/drat).
